Proj: A small project IDE for emacs

# Project Management
## Todo
## Backlog
- Git the project

### Create the correct workflow
- lazy list for get-first-common-elt
- Refactor mock-files so that it stays in test scope
- separate tools from proj code



## Done
#### use second latest file to always display 2 files ####

  + change get-rel-file test to account for this
  + update get-rel-file so it does the job
#### Shortcut for tdd
+ have a shortcut to save, eval and test at point just like elpy
+ have a shortcut to run all tests



## Larger Backlog
- emacs should autosave correctly
  - done as a minor mode?
  - version history?
	- conflicts with git
- improve your IDE for test/code loop
